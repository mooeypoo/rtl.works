Putting direction attributes in the &lt;html&gt; or &lt;body&gt; is always a good idea. The default direction of an html and body block are 'ltr', but your html might be used in other environment that have different definitions. For example:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Email:</strong> If you are sending an HTML email - or if anyone else is sending a piece of your website in an email - the content directionality can be decided by the client. If the email client is set to right-to-left, your content (even if it is only left-to-right) might get jumbled. Setting directionality is a good idea <strong>especially</strong> if you plan to send the HTML in an email.</li>
	<li><strong>If your site includes user-submitted content</strong>: In that case, you should consider that some of the content might be in right-to-left. In that case, you should be careful about the directionality you define in general. You might want to take a look at <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-unicode-controls">bidirectionality isolation</a>. <em>Watching out from mixed content is a good idea in any case.<em></li>
</ul>
